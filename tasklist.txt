In progress:
-----------

Add cross track support:
 - enforce placement rules for more complex shapes
 - allow rotating
*- change mouse cursor on select
*- show indicator of valid/invalid placement
*- add support for shape segments

Moving emitters:
 - test more advanced shapes
*- basic movement
*- check for bounds and change direction
*- fix collisions between emitters and beatbugs

Examine logging with consideration to performance:
 - consider removing uninteresting frames
 
Port emitter movement logic to beatbug

Enhance drawing of shadow for selected assistant.
Draw allowed placements underneath bugs, but over
tracks.

Implement a tile map:

Add panel for side menu:

----------------------------------------


Complete:
--------

* Add a pause button:
* - add a hud
*  - add a button class
*  - add a timeline / scheduler
 
* Investigate addition of a ui-theme:
*  - research existing libraries

* UI enhancements:
* - Look into editing themes in pygame_gui
* - Tidy up ui_element management code
* - Implement unique button colours with themes
* - Add resource file - for additional layout options

* Investigate issues with multiple sounds playing simultaneously
 ** Not an audio issue - a sequencing issue. Sounds played out
    of synch/sequence can just be discordant
 
 Synchronisation:
*- emitters
*- fix turning corners
*- fix pause
*- investigate synchronisation of emitters/beatbugs over 
   extended time range
*- investigate possibility of controlling timing of movement 
   through timeline. added a mechanism based on relative time
   and distance from point of departure
