Features and improvements:
-------------------------

Investigate the ease of implementing a level editor

Improve Assistants 2:
 - highlighting assistant should surround shape rather than nodes
 - enforce placement rules for more complex shapes

Moving emitters 2:
 - test more advanced shapes
 - test crossing bugtrack in more than one place
 
Test fast beatbugs.
 - handle mid-movement cornering

Build some tunes:
Build a level!!
 
Level start countdown:
 - 3 - 2 - 1 - disco

Enhance drawing of shadow for selected assistant.
Draw allowed placements underneath bugs, but over
tracks.

Implement a tile map:

Add panel for side menu:

Add new assistant types:
 - splitters? tunnellers? (flatbugs?)
 - container/capacitor
 - pivoters
 - butterflies

Make/find some graphics:

Investigate Midi:
 - Could a level palette be built from a midi sequence?
 
Improve Stability:
 - Add exception handling
 
Optimizations:
 - When an assistant has been anchored, store the locations
   of the anchored nodes - would avoid having to look them 
   up by root + offset

----------------------------------------


Complete:
--------

* Occasionally, pausing causes beatbug jumping at corners
* - Fix in place many days ago - last seen many days ago
* - Closing this for now as a lot of refactoring has happened
    around movement logic. Will reopen if behaviour reoccurs.

* Update level data definition:
* - data format
* - port emitter movement logic to beatbug
* - use exit system (like emitters/assistants)

* Improve Assistants 1:
* - gorilla test rotating, detaching, replacing, suspending, pausing, etc
* - allow rotating 
* - remove assistant - right-click returns assistant to placement
* - cancel selected assistant - escape key

* Investigate drawing of mouse outside of GroupSingle

* Add cross track support:
* - change mouse cursor on select
* - show indicator of valid/invalid placement
* - add support for shape segments

* Moving emitters:
* - basic movement
* - check for bounds and change direction
* - fix collisions between emitters and beatbugs

* Suspend assistant:
* - show suspended timer
* - add support for info text 
* - highlight assistant on mouseover
* - show suspended indicator
* - each left click suspends an additional second

* Change emitter colour when playing

* Examine logging with consideration to performance:
* - consider removing uninteresting frames

* Synchronisation:
* - emitters
* - fix turning corners
* - fix pause
* - investigate synchronisation of emitters/beatbugs over 
    extended time range
* - investigate possibility of controlling timing of movement 
    through timeline. added a mechanism based on relative time
    and distance from point of departure

* Add a pause button:
* - add a hud
*  - add a button class
*  - add a timeline / scheduler
 
* Investigate addition of a ui-theme:
*  - research existing libraries

* UI enhancements:
* - Look into editing themes in pygame_gui
* - Tidy up ui_element management code
* - Implement unique button colours with themes
* - Add resource file - for additional layout options

* Investigate issues with multiple sounds playing simultaneously
 ** Not an audio issue - a sequencing issue. Sounds played out
    of synch/sequence can just be discordant
 

Defects Complete:
----------------
* FIXED: Placement of assistants is possible over other assistants.
